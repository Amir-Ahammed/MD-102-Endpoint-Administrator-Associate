# Introduction to Microsoft 365 and Azure
This topic provides a foundational overview of Microsoft 365 and Microsoft Azure â€” two core components of the modern Microsoft cloud ecosystem. It explains how Microsoft 365 delivers cloud-based productivity and collaboration tools (like Teams, Intune, Exchange, and SharePoint), while Azure provides the underlying cloud infrastructure and identity services (like Entra ID, VMs, networking, and security). It also highlights how these platforms integrate to support secure identity management, device compliance, and enterprise-level IT operations.

## ðŸ”· What is Microsoft 365?
Microsoft 365 is a cloud-based productivity suite (PaaS) that includes:
  * **Office Apps**: Word, Excel, Outlook, PowerPoint (web and desktop versions)
  * **Exchange Online**: Cloud-based email and calendaring
  * **SharePoint Online**: Document management and intranet services
  * **OneDrive for Business**: Cloud storage
  * **Microsoft Teams**: Chat, video meetings, and collaboration
  * **Intune**: Device and application management (MDM/MAM)

## ðŸ”· What is Microsoft Azure?
Azure is Microsoftâ€™s cloud platform offering infrastructure, platform, and software services (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS).
  * **Azure Virtual Machines**: Cloud-based Windows/Linux servers
  * **Azure Storage**: Blob, file, queue, and disk storage
  * **Azure Networking**: Virtual networks, firewalls, VPNs
  * **Azure Active Directory (Entra ID)**: Identity service used across Microsoft 365
  * **Azure Monitor & Defender**: Security, monitoring, and compliance tools
  * **Azure AD Connect**: Syncs on-premises AD with Entra ID (hybrid identity)

## ðŸ”· How Microsoft 365 and Azure Work Together
Microsoft 365 = The tools you use | Azure = The engine that powers those tools
  * Single Sign-On (SSO) across Microsoft 365 and Azure
  * Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) via Azure
  * Licensing & Role Management is unified using Microsoft Admin Centers
  * Device management and compliance enforced via Microsoft Intune integrated with Azure AD
